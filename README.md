## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I improved my skills in CSS Grid and responsive design. I learned how to use grid-template-areas for complex layouts and how to make the design adapt smoothly to different screen sizes.

```css
.testimonials-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr);
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my CSS Grid skills and explore more advanced responsive techniques, such as container queries and CSS clamp for font sizing.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks: A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Helped me understand grid properties and layout patterns.
- [MDN Web Docs: Responsive design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) - Great resource for responsive design best practices.
