### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://testimonials-grid-section-101.netlify.app/](https://testimonials-grid-section-101.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I improved my skills in CSS Grid and responsive design. I learned how to use grid-template-areas for complex layouts and how to make the design adapt smoothly to different screen sizes.

```css
.testimonials-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr);
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my CSS Grid skills and explore more advanced responsive techniques, such as container queries and CSS clamp for font sizing.
